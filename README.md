# CVE_Assessment_01_2018
These were vulnerabilities found during the installation and download of the VideoScribe software v3.1.0. The software may allow that unverifiable Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) streams in combination with suspicious websites succeed in an arbitrary code injection. The event could be triggered by packed icon files in the *.msi file or by PE executable files embedded in the software that revealed itself as a document (*.doc) file, suggesting some degree of file impersonation.
